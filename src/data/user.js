I’m currently working at a startup called meSO Groupe Inc., where I’m involved in developing scalable REST APIs and working on full-stack projects using technologies like React Native, Nest.js, and MongoDB. I’ve also had the chance to intern at Cisco and Bell Canada, where I worked on AI and LLM-based projects at Cisco, and complex event processing with Apache Flink at Bell, focusing on a variety of backend and frontend tasks.",
